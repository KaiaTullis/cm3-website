## Practice Compsci Assignment

### My coding playground

<!-- This is commented out. -->

Just write to start a para. Use `**word**` to bold **word**. Use `*word*` to italicise *word*. For a new para, you need to hit return at-least twice.


**B** *O* **L** *D*

This is another para.

  
In this one, we show some lists. just start the list on the next line after hitting one return:
- an item
- another item

In this new para, we create a numbered list using numbers.
1. first item
2. second item

**Color Experiments**
New list method 

- <font color="red"> Some red text </font>
- <font color="orange"> Some orange text </font>
- <font color="yellow"> Some yellow text </font>
- <font color="green"> Some green text </font>
- <font color="blue"> Some blue text </font>
- <font color="purple"> Some purple text </font>

This shorthand is called Markdown. It is a general text format used almost everywhere on the web. [Google](https://www.google.com) (see how I made this link) about it to learn more.

You can write code by using triple-ticks:

```python
def add_two(x, y):
  return x + y
```

This page illustrates low code principles. In exchange for giving up pixel-level control of the page you can make web pages easily through a simple text file.
